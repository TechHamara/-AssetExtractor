# AssetExtractor

## An extension made to extract project media files/assets to the cache, where they are accesible for processing. 

# Doccumentation

## The extension is pretty straight forward: 
 - 1. Install the extension
 - 2. Drag the extension on the screen
 - 3. Use the `GetAssetFullFilePath` block, with the name of the asset *(`foo.png` for example)*
 - 4. ENJOY!! The function returns the full path of the asset, either saved in cache, or in the AI2 Development folder, automatically determined/detected by the extension.

*(If the asset is not found in cache, it is extracted from the app to the cache automatically)*
